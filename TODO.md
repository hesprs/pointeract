# Todo

This file is used to show the current focus of maintainers, your contributions are not limited to these tasks.

- [x] transform to adapt modularity practice (main class maintains `pointers` map only, other imports share map and register hooks)
- [ ] add rotate functionality to `multiPointer_zanZoom`.
- [ ] support multi-element init, add / remove monitoring element and API.
- [ ] prototype `PointeractManager`.
